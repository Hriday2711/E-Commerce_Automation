# E-Commerce_Automation

Overview:

This is a sample Automation (includes Web and API) project for "Automation Exercise" e-Commerce website "https://automationexercise.com/". 

Tools and Technologies:

The following are the key tools and technologies have been used in this E-Commerce Automation project:

1. Programming/Scripting language: Java
2. Web Automation tool: Selenium
3. API Automation tool: Rest-Assured
4. Testing framework: TestNG

Scope:

In this project, we have covered the Web UI Automation test-cases and API test-cases using Selenium and Rest-assured respectively. We have written the automation scripts in BDD (Behavior Driven Development) 
Gherkin-Cucumber syntax and have created the feature files accordingly. This framework is a Hybrid framework which includes Data-Driven testing and KeyWord testing as well.

Reporting:

For Reporting, this framework is capable to generate the cucumber.html and cucumber.json files whenever any feature file is ran. Also, this framework has capability to generate beautiful reports using Extent-Report library.

Challenges:

Currently, we are in developing a CI Pipeline for this automation framework and that will help to execute the test-cases on a remote server instead on a local machine.
