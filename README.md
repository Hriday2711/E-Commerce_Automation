1. Java is the programming language for this framework
2. Selenium automation tool is used to support the web automation while, Rest- assured is used for API automation

Scope:

In this project, we have covered the Web UI Automation test-cases and API test-cases using Selenium and Rest-assured respectively. We have written the automation scripts in BDD (Behavior Driven Development) Gherkin-Cucumber syntax and have created the feature files accordingly. This framework is a Hybrid framework which includes Data-Driven testing and KeyWord testing as well.

Key Features:

1. Modular Framework: Framework is organized separate modules for easy maintenance and scalability.
2. Page Object Model (POM): Implemented the POM design pattern for a clear separation of page elements and test logic.
3. Cross-Browser testing: This framework supports the testing on other browsers like chrome, edge, safari, firefox etc.
4. Data-Driven testing: Framework supports the test-execution for different data-sets to achieve the comprehensive test-coverage (for example, via .properties file)
5. Logging: Framework has an excellent logging mechanism which is helpful to track and troubleshoot the test-execution.
6. Custom-Reporting: This framework has the capability to generate beautiful reports as it has integrated the Extent Report library.
